frex.js Web Framework
=======

A framework for creating modern web applications, it's easy-use for front-end developer and JavaScript people. frex.js is NOT a traditional MVC web framework. It aims to provide a new way to develop web service without server-side knowledge.

With integration of front-end/back-end web development experiences, it uses pure JavaScript method instead of tranditional web communication methods. There is no need to understand GET/POST methods of HTTP protocol and implement AJAX stuffs directly, developer totally can write a web service with front-end web development experence only.

frex.js is based on Express web framework in Node.js, it means developer who is already familiar with node.js development do not need to learn new things for using frex.js, and furthermore, it can support all express middleware. If you do not want to use special feature of frex.js, you can still do your job under old school MVC model.
